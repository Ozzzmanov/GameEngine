Project GameEngine is a 3D object editor based on OpenGL 3.3 and the LWJGL 3.3.1 library, allowing users to load, display, and transform 3D models.

Technologies Used:

OpenGL 3.3 – for rendering graphics.

LWJGL 3.3.1 – for working with OpenGL, GLFW, and window management.

GLFW – for handling input and creating a window context.

JOML – a library for 3D mathematics (matrices, vectors).]

ImGui (imgui-java) – for building a graphical user interface (GUI).


Key Features:

Loading 3D models in .obj format.

Rendering models with shader materials.

Node system for managing scene objects.

Transformation editor (translation, rotation, scaling).

Built-in grid for spatial navigation.

Object selection and editing within the scene.

Lighting effects and material processing.
