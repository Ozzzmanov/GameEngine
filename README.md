Project GameEngine is a 3D object editor based on OpenGL 3.3 and the LWJGL 3.3.1 library, allowing users to load, display, and transform 3D models.

 Technologies Used:

- OpenGL 3.3 – for rendering graphics.  
- LWJGL 3.3.1 – for working with OpenGL, GLFW, and window management.  
- GLFW – for handling input and creating a window context.  
- JOML – a library for 3D mathematics (matrices, vectors).  
- ImGui (imgui-java) – for building a graphical user interface (GUI).  

 Key Features:

- Loading 3D models in `.obj` format.  
- Rendering models with shader materials.  
- Node system for managing scene objects.  
- Transformation editor (translation, rotation, scaling).  
- Built-in grid for spatial navigation.  
- Object selection and editing within the scene.  
- Scene system for saving, loading, and creating custom scenes.  
- Texture mapping support for applying image-based textures to 3D objects.  
- Shadows rendering for enhanced depth and realism.  
- Advanced lighting system, including specular highlights and reflections.
